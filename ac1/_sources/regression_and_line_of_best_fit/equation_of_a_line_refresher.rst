  :alt: Slope intercept form: y equals m times x plus b.

All line equations in this text will be presented in the form y = m*x + b, where
m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. This is also called slope intercept
form. The **y-intercept** is the y-value at the point where the line crosses the
y-axis. The :ref:`slope <interpreting-slope>` gives the steepness of the line,
and can be positive, negative, or zero.

  :alt: A graph of the equation y equals negative one third times x plus five and the slope is negative.

This figure depicts an equation of a line that has a y-intercept of 5 and a negative slope.

  :width: 49%
  :alt: A graph of the equation of y equals 2 times x plus one. 

The equation of the line in the above figure has a y-intercept of 1 and a positive slope.
